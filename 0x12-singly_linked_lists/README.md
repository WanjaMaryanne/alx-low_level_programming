A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, resembling a chain of connected nodes. Each node contains two components: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node, called the head, initiates the list, while the last node points to a null reference, signifying the end. This unidirectional structure facilitates efficient traversal from one node to the next, but the absence of a backward link limits easy navigation in reverse. To add a new element to the list, it involves creating a new node, updating the link in the current last node to point to the new one, and designating the new node as the new tail. Conversely, removing a node entails adjusting the link in the preceding node to bypass the deleted one. Singly linked lists are space-efficient, as they only necessitate storing the data and a single link per node, making them versatile for dynamic data storage. However, their main drawback is the lack of direct access to previous elements, requiring a linear search from the head to locate a specific node. Despite this limitation, singly linked lists are extensively used in applications like symbol tables, job scheduling, and implementing more complex data structures like stacks and queues.
