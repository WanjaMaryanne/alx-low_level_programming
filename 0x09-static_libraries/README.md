This project is aimed at helping one understand the concept of static libraries, through the basics of creating, using, and managing static libraries in C language.

A static library is a collection of object files (compiled C source code) bundled together into a single file. These object files can contain various functions and data that your program can use. Static libraries are a common way to share and reuse code across different programs, making your code more modular and maintainable.
