## Introduction

Welcome to the Preprocessor Project! This project is a preprocessor that allows you to process and manipulate source code files before they are compiled or interpreted. It can be a valuable tool for various programming tasks, such as code generation, conditional compilation, and more.

## Features

- **Macro Expansion:** Define and expand macros in your source code.
- **Conditional Compilation:** Include or exclude code blocks based on preprocessor directives.
- **File Inclusion:** Include other source code files in your main source file.
- **Configurable:** Customize the behavior of the preprocessor through configuration files.
- **Extensible:** Easily extend the preprocessor with custom directives or plugins.
